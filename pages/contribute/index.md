It took a lot of effort to create CMintS as a side project, it's an open source
project and each Github Start counts to make it popular, so if you appear to
have a Github account and you like this project, I'll really appreciate if you
can start the project on [it's Github page](https://github.com/cmints/cmints).

you can help me spot issues with it and fix it, in order to update the

### Translations

Translation is the one of the core features of CMintS and I'll really apreciate if you can help me to translate current documentation into the Languages you speak, so if you are up for it, please check the resource about [translating documentation](/contribute/translation)
